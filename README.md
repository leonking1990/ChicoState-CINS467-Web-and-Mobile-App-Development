# Assignment 5 - PokéDex App

## Summary

This app serves as a simple yet functional PokéDex, designed to leverage the [Pokémon API](https://pokeapi.co/) for fetching and displaying Pokémon data. It's crafted with a focus on user-friendly design principles and demonstrates effective interaction with REST APIs using Dart's `http` package. This project is still a work in progress, and while some features are under development, all requirements for Assignment 5 have been met.

## Features

### Simple and User-friendly UI
- Implements a minimalist and intuitive design to guide users through its functionalities smoothly.
- Key UI components, such as the search bar and information display areas, are strategically placed to enhance user interactions.
- Interactive elements allow for seamless retrieval and viewing of Pokémon data, providing an engaging user experience.

### Retrieve Data from a REST API
- Employs the Dart `http` package to execute HTTP GET requests, efficiently fetching data from the Pokémon API.
- Showcases the ability to connect with web services beyond classroom examples, reinforcing concepts related to REST API integration.

### Display Data in an Engaging Manner
- Detailed Pokémon information (e.g., ID, Name, Height, Weight, Type) is elegantly presented, extracted directly from the API response.
- Pokémon stats (e.g., HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, Speed) are displayed in a visually appealing format, utilizing Flutter widgets like `Text`, `ListTile`, and `Card`.
- Processes and formats data to ensure readability and visual appeal, moving beyond the presentation of raw JSON to offer a refined view of Pokémon characteristics.

### Ongoing Development Note
- **This app is currently in development**. Some planned features are not yet implemented, but the core functionalities required for Assignment 5 are fully operational. I am working to enhance the app with more features and improvements.

### Technical Highlights
- **Built with Dart and Flutter**: Demonstrates the versatility of Dart and Flutter in creating cross-platform mobile applications.
- **REST API Integration**: Features robust implementation of network requests to public APIs, highlighting essential web communication techniques.
- **Effective State Management**: Ensures a dynamic and responsive UI by managing state changes based on user inputs and API responses.
