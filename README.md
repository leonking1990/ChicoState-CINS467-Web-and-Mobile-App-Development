# Assignment 3

## Summery

I used the sample app from the Flutter create command as a template and expanded it to add more functionality.
the app can add, remove, and clear the current count in the counter.

## Details about my project:

* **Having At Least Three Buttons**
  * The 3 properties of each button:
    * has child Icon
    * has onPressed
      * Each button unique action would be ether add to, remove from, or clear the current count in the counter.
      * For the label each button has an icon to imply its function.
    * style 
      * each button has an unique color.
      * the add button is circular 
* **Have At Least Two Text Widgets**
  * Each Text widget must contain at least 2 properties:
    * each has unique data
    * style (an instance of the TextStyle class that is used to style the text)
      * each has its personalized style of color, size and/or font.
* **Make Updates When Each Button Is Pressed**
  * first button has a function that add one to the counter it has an add icon.
  * second button have a function to remove one from the counter ans had a remove (subtract) icon.
  * third button has a function to clear the counter reverting it back to 0 and have an cancel icon.
